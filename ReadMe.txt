AutoBackup 1.0.1

The purpose of the program is to create automatically incremental backup copies of files that get accessed and updated continuously when working at a project. Examples may include spreadsheets, code scripts, word processing documents, music creation files.

Instructions:
- Copy to your project folder, to the desktop or to any other folder the Windows executable file or the Python script (if you have Python installed) .
- Drag and Drop on the program icon the file you wish to backup.
- The program will create a "backup" folder in your project folder, if it doesn't already exist.
- A copy of the file will be now created in the "backup" folder with a ".bkp" extension. When you create a new backup a number will be added after the .bkp extension, and the number will increase as you create new backup copies.
